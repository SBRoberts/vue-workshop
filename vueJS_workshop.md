# Vue Workshop
## Getting started with Vue.js, for people who hear React is cool

---

### Welcome to Intro to Vue Workshop
Vue is a wonderful library for building single-page applications, web-apps, and enhancing front-end user experience of existing sites. Today we will be building a simple application to search for Github repos, first using the CDN, then followed by enahncing the process with the Vue CLI.

### Getting started: Slides + Starter Files
You will find all of the necessary starter files and resources in the following repo: [https://github.com/rbnhmll/vue-workshop/](https://github.com/rbnhmll/vue-workshop/)

This package includes a number of files, including START and COMPLETE versions of both apps, and the class slides.

### What is Vue?

* Javascript framework from building front-end UI
* In the same category as React, Preact, Angular and Ember
* Create more maintainable codebase

### Why Vue?

* Easy to learn.
* It's mostly just HTML, CSS, javascript.
* Size:
  Relatively small library compared with others
  | Library                  | Minified  | GZipped   |
  | ------------------------ | :-------: | :-------: |
  | Angular 2                | 566K      | 111K      |
  | Ember 2.2.0              | 435K      | 111K      |
  | React 16.2.0 + React DOM | 97.5K     | 31.8K     |
  | **Vue 2.4.2**            | **58.8K** | **20.9K** |
  | Preact 7.2.0             | 16K       | 4K        |

### Features

* Progressive Javascript framework: add to just one part of your application.
* Scalable eco-system.
* Reusable components, with their own template, scripts and styles.
* All the best parts of React and Angular, without the bloat.

### Get started with just the CDN

* Grab the [CDN](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Getting-Started) or [download](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Direct-lt-script-gt-Include) the .js file
* Note: there are Development and Production versions of both.
  * **Development** version includes helpful console warnings. (we will be using this one.)
  * **Production** version is optimized for size and speed

We're going to styart by opening up the project **cdn--START**. Here we have some pre-built styles and HTML to get us started building our application.

### Add CDN script

Add the CDN at the bottom of the body
```html
...
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
</body>
```

### Vue.js devtools
Install the Vue Devtools for you preferred browser

[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en)
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/)

Open up the browser inspector/devtools, and click on the Vue tab.

### Devtools gotchas
  * If the page uses a production/minified build of Vue.js, devtools inspection is disabled by default so the Vue pane won't show up.
  * To make it work for pages opened via `file://` protocol, you need to check "Allow access to file URLs" for this extension in Chrome's extension management panel.

### The Vue Instance

Add an `id` to the part of our page where the application will live. We'll use the id `app`.

```html
<body>
  <div id="app" class="wrapper">
  ...
```

Next, instantiate the Vue instance

```html
...
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
  <script>
    const app = new Vue({
      el: "#app",
      data: {}
    });
  </script>
</body>
```

* el: The id of the element our app should be rendered in
* data (aka state): data saved within our app. This is an object.

### Declarative Rendering

Add some dynamic messages to the searching and error sections, by declaring a key and value on the data object.

```javascript
const app = new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  data: {
    searchingMessage: "Searching...",
    errorMessage: "Oops, nothing here üí©"
  }
});
```
We can then render these messages inside of our `app` template using the `{{ propertyName }}` syntax.

```html
  ...
  <section class="searching">
    <p>{{ searchingMessage }}</p>
  </section>

  <section class="errors">
    <h2>{{ errorMessage }}</h2>
  </section>
  ...
```

> ‚òù Note: Notice that we can reference the property on the data object directly, without having to reference the main `app` object, like `app.data.searchingMessage`.

### Vue Directives (and arguments)

* `v-model` (two-way data binding)
* `v-on` (event binding) [shortcut: `@`]
* `v-if` (conditional rendering)
* `v-for` (render loop)
* `v-bind` (attributes) [shortcut: `:`]

### Directives: `v-model`

In order to search for repos on Github, we need to grab the query string, and pass it to the API call. Let's add the query as an empty string to our data object.

```javascript
data: {
  q: "",
  searchingMessage: "Searching...",
  errorMessage: "Oops, nothing here üí©"
}
```

Now we need a way to get this information from the `input[type="search"]`, and save it to our `q` property for use later. But! At the same time, if we have a property saved in our data object already, we want to make sure that we update the input to reflect that data. The simplest way to achieve this is using two-way data minding with `v-model`

```html
<form>
  <input type="search" name="search" id="search" required v-model="q">
  <label for="search">Repo search</label>
</form>
```

Open up the Vue devtools, and notice that as we type in the input, it automatically updates the state. Also notice that if we change, or pre-populate the state, this is automatically updated in the bound input. This is the power of two-way data binding.

### Methods

Now that we have the users search query, we want to use it to call our github API, and bring back some data. We'll create a couple of methods: the first is what we will call to fetch the data from the API, and the second is a method to reset our app before making another search call.

We'll start by adding a `methods` property to our `app`. Methods is an `object`.

```javascript
const app = new Vue({
  el: "#app",
  data: {
    q: "",
    searchingMessage: "Searching...",
    errorMessage: "Oops, nothing here üí©"
  },
  methods: {}
});
```

The endpoint we'll use to fetch this data is `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q={query}`.

We'll also add a couple of other properties to our state to keep track if we are currently searching, or if there has been an error. We also want to add a property to save our returned repos into. This will be an array.

```javascript
data: {
  q: "",
  repos: [],
  searching: false,
  searchingMessage: "Searching...",
  errorHandling: false,
  errorMessage: "Oops, nothing here üí©"
}
```

Let's build our `search` method which will take care of the following steps:
  - Prevent the form form refreshing the page on submit
  - Set our searching property to `true`
  - Call `resetSearch` (we'll build this method next)
  - Save the response in a `const`, and then convert to usable `json`
  - Change the searching propert to false, now that we're finished searching.
  - If we got some responses, we want to save it to our `data` in `repos`
  - If we get no repos back, then we want to set the `errorHandling` to `true`.

```javascript
methods: {
  async search(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.searching = true;
    this.resetSearch();
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=${this.q}`);

    const json = await response.json();
    this.searching = false;
    if (json.items.length) {
      this.repos = json.items;
    } else {
      this.errorHandling = true;
    }
  }
}
```

Next we will create the method `resetSearch` to reset the `errorhandling`, and return `repos` to an ampty array.

```javascript
methods: {
  async search(q) {
    ...
  },
  resetSearch() {
    this.errorHandling = false;
    this.repos = [];
  }
}
```

Remove `e.preventDefault()` from our search method

```javascript
methods: {
  async search() {
    ...
```

>‚òù Note: Notice the `this` keyword in our methods? This is how we will reference any data property or method from within another part of our app, instead of referencing `app`.

### Directives: Event Handling with `v-on`

We need to hook up our form, so that when it submits it calls the search method. We can use the directive `v-on` to listed to DOM events, such as submit. We then pass in a reference to the method we want to be called.

```html
<form v-on:submit="search">
  ...
</form>
```

Now that our `search` method has been called, we should have up to 30 objects in our `repos` array.

### Event modifiers

Now, calling `preventDefault()` on the submit event is fine, but there's also a Vue way of modifying these types of events, which is more concise.
  
`v-on:submit.prevent="search"`
  * Prevent default search behaviour
`v-model.number="example"`
  * Forces a chosen data type.

We can tack on a modifier to the event handler, instead of stating it in the method.

```html
<form v-on:submit.prevent="search">
  ...
</form>
```

### Directives: Conditional Rendering with `v-if`

Using conditional rendering with `v-if`, we can decide to only show the results section if there are repos, and `searching` and `errorHandling` sections when applicable.

```html
...
<section class="results" v-if="repos.length">
  ...
</section>
...
<section class="searching" v-if="searching">
  <p>{{ searchingMessage }}</p>
</section>

<section class="errors" v-if="errorHandling">
  <h2>{{ errorMessage }}</h2>
</section>
...
```

<!-- ### Listening for Events -->

### Directives: `v-for`

Now that we have some repos in our data, it's time to loop over them, and display them on the page. We can loop over an array of items in our `data` using `v-for`.

Be use this directive on the element which needs to be repeated. In this case, the `<li>`.

```html
...
<section class="results">
  <ul>
    <li class="repo" v-for="repo in repos">
    ...
```

Now we have a variable `repo` which represents each iteration. We can use this to fill in some of the dummy content on our cards.

```html
...
<li class="repo" v-for="repo in repos">
  ...
    <div class="repo__meta">
      <p>
        <strong>Dev:</strong> {{ repo.owner.login }}
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Repo:</strong> {{ repo.name }}
      </p>
    </div>
  ...
</li>
...
```

>‚òù Note: While we can use the `{{ }}` syntax to render text content, we cannot use this within attributes. Follow along to the next step to see how we `bind` data to these attributes.

### Directives: `v-bind`

In order to bind data to attributes in vue, we have to use another directive called (you guess it) `v-bind`. This will allow us to dynamically update attributes.

In our cards above, we still need to hook up the `<a href="">`, and `<img src="" alt="`.

```javascript
...
<li class="repo" v-for="repo in repos">
  <a v-bind:href="repo.html_url" class="repo__link">
    <div class="repo__image">
      <img v-bind:src="repo.owner.avatar_url" v-bind:alt="repo.full_name">
    </div>
    ...
  </a>
</li>
...
```

### Directive shorthands

Writing `v-on` and `v-bind` on everything can get a little tedious after a while, so there are some convenient shortcuts we can use to save some space/time.

  * `v-on:` can be replaced with `@`
  * `v-bind:` can be written as just `:`

Let's update our code as follows:

```html
...
<form @submit="search">
  ...
</form>
...
<li class="repo" v-for="repo in repos">
  <a :href="repo.html_url" class="repo__link">
    <div class="repo__image">
      <img :src="repo.owner.avatar_url" :alt="repo.full_name">
    </div>
    ...
  </a>
</li>
```

### Component Registration: `Vue.component`

Now that we have a working application, we can think about splitting the parts of our app into smaller components, in order to make them easier to manage. It might not seem very necessary at this scale, but becomes increasingly helpful as your application expands.

Let's start by separating some of the smaller parts of our app into componets, such as the `searching` and `errors` sections.

First, we need to Register a new component, using `Vue.component()`. This method takes two arguments: a `name: String`, and a `config: Object`.

```javascript
Vue.component('searching', {});
```

Inside the congig Object, we can add data specific to this component, such as a `template` and `data` Object.

```javascript
Vue.component('searching', {
  template: "",
  data() {
    return {};
  },
});
```

> ‚òù Note: Notice that the `data` property on our component looks a little different than before? Because components are reusable, we can no longer declare our state as an `Object`. If we did, every instance of that component would share the same data.
> Instead, we made `data` a `function`, which returns an `Object`. This way, each component will have unique data.

Now, we can move the HTML `searchingMessage` in our `app` to the `data` in our component.

```javascript
Vue.component('searching', {
  template: "",
  data() {
    return {
      searchingMessage: "Searching...",
    };
  },
});
```

Let's take the HTML for the `searching section`, and put it inside of our template. You can use back-ticks in order make them multi-line.

```javascript
Vue.component('searching', {
  template: `
    <section class="searching">
      <p>{{searchingMessage}}</p>
    </section>
  `,
  data() {
    return {
      searchingMessage: "Searching...",
    };
  },
});
```

Finally, we can render our component in our app, by using the component name as the element. Let's also include the `v-if` from before.

```html
<div id="app" class="wrapper">
  ...
  <searching v-if="searching"></searching>
  ...
</div>
```

> ‚òù Note: You can't use self-closing components like `<my-component />` in Vue DOM templates, because it is not valid HTML. Still valid and recommended in single-file components.
> Components must also be lower-case, and cabab-case.

Let's do the same thing for the `errors` section.

```html
<div id="app" class="wrapper">
  ...
  <searching v-if="searching"></searching>
  <errors v-if="errorHandling"></errors>
  ...
</div>
```
```javascript
Vue.component('errors', {
  template: `
    <section class="errors">
      <h2>{{errorMessage}}</h2>
    </section>
  `,
  data() {
    return {
      errorMessage: "Oops, nothing here üí©",
    };
  },
});
```

### Component Data

### Props
  * `[]` vs `{}`
  * Sataic vs dynamic
  * cabab-case

### Emit events


### Using vue-cli (like create-react-app)

* Install vue-cli [https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli), `$ npm install -g @vue/cli`
* Create project
  `$ vue create <project-name>`
* Start Server
  `$ npm run serve`
* Download example project `cli--COMPLETE`
* Vue plugin for Chrome and Firefox
* Single File Components
* Props
* computed properties
* Lifecycle Hooks?
* Notes and Gotchas:
  * In components, must use `data` as a function which returns an object, or it will not work
  * You can't use self-closing components like `<my-component />` in Vue DOM templates, because it is not valid HTML. Still valid and recommended in single-file components.

### Run with it!

Vue has a bunch of additional tools which parallel other popular frameworks

* Vuex (like Redux)
* Vue-router (like React-router)
* Nuxt.js (SSR)

#### To update:
 - In CDN example, update notes to include re-factoring using registered components.
